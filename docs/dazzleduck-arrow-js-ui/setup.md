# Setup

> This guide explains how to run the **DazzleDuck Arrow JS UI** locally and in production.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js **18+**
- npm or pnpm
- Running DazzleDuck SQL HTTP Server

---

## Local Development

```bash

```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash

```

---

## Backend Configuration

The UI connects to the HTTP server using a base URL:

```env
VITE_DAZZLEDUCK_HTTP_URL=http://localhost:8081
```

This can be configured via:

- `.env` file
- Build‑time environment variables


---

## Connect to the Server

Connection settings panel, fill in:

| Field                 | Value                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
